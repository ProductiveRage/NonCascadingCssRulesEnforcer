            <summary>
            All instances returned from requests to the Next property will share the same TextReaderWithReadAheadEvent instance and use this as the
            synchronisation object when any operations that must be thread safe will occur. This includes any calls to Read since it must be guaranteed
            that each Read call can transmit the read character(s) to any TextReaderStringNavigator instances that are lagging behind to ensure that
            their catchUpQueue is complete. A lock must also be obtained any time that a new TextReaderStringNavigator is created that shares the
            TextReaderWithReadAheadEvent instance since its constructor will register with the ReadAhead event and mustn't miss any data from Read requests
            that may occur during the class' instantiation. By extension a lock must be obtained any time that the catchUpQueue is accessed (either to
            retrieve data or to change the contents) since its contents may be changed where the ReadAhead subscription is processed which may be
            across multiple threads. The catchUpQueue's purpose is to allow instances of TextReaderStringNavigator that lag behind the wrapped
            TextReaderWithReadAheadEvent to return CurrentCharacter data without having to query the TextReaderWithReadAheadEvent (which won't be able
            to help since it has progressed past the TextReaderStringNavigator's position). This mechanism can't prevent the source TextReader from being
            progressed by another object with a reference to the TextReader but it does guarantee that all of the TextReaderStringNavigator instances will
            have data consistent with the other TextReaderStringNavigator instances at all times. The TextReaderWithReadAheadEvent being private is an
            extra layer of insurance that its Read method will not be called without the proper locks in place and should help ensure that a reference
            to TextReaderWithReadAheadEvents can not be leaked out which could risk deadlocks as they are used as the synchronisation object.

            The parsing performed by these methods is intended to be as cheap as possible but in exchange it performs only simplistic parsing of the
            content (it doesn't differentiate between selectors - eg. "div.Header h2.Name, div.Footer" and style property names - eg. "color" - for
            example). The quality of the data may be improved by passing the returned CategorisedCharacterString set through the
            LessCssHierarchicalParser, this WILL differentiate between selectors and style property names and will represent nested styles (for
            LESS CSS content) and styles nested within media queries. It requires an additional processing step, though.
